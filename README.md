# prerequisite packages

install prerequisite packages with the following command

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install libboost1.71-dev
```

# usage

Create an Allocator object with the following line.

```c++
::Allocator allocator;
```

Create your task as the code shown below.

```c++
  map<int, vector<Task> > tasks{
    {0,{Task{1,2},Task{1,1},Task{1,3}}},
    {1,{Task{2,1},Task{1,2},Task{1,5}}},
    {2,{Task{2,1},Task{1,4},Task{1,5}}},
    {3,{Task{1,4},Task{1,2}}},
    {4,{Task{2,1},Task{1,2}}},
    {5,{Task{1,2}}}
  };
```

**Task{1,2}** means that this task occupies 1 memory slot for 2 timestamps.

The optimal memory assignment which takes the least memory address range is generated by the following line.

```c++
Assignment assignment = allocator.solve(tasks);
```

The returned container represents how the assignment is done.
